1. Created this project to understand the path-finding algorithm thoroughly . Technologies used for building this project -
React, JavaScript, and Dijkstra's algorithm for path-finding.

2. This project worked fine for the case, where we create a wall between a source node and the destination node , for
that case as well it finds out the shortest path between a source node and the destination node.
